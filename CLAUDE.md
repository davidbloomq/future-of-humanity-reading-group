# Future of Humanity Reading Group

## Overview

A biweekly reading group surveying foundational literature in **macro strategy** — Nick Bostrom's term for the effort to understand how our current choices relate to long-term outcomes and ultimate values. Draws on philosophy, economics, physics, computer science, sociology, and political science. Week 1 (Foundations) has met; Week 2 is upcoming.

> "My research efforts, while they may appear scattershot, generally share one aim, which is to better understand what I call our 'macrostrategic situation'. By this I mean the larger context in which human civilization exists, and in particular how our current choices relate to long-term outcomes or ultimate values. I think we are fairly profoundly in the dark on such matters. You could say that we are like ants, who may be very busy schlepping needles from one point to another, but with little notion as to what they are doing, why they are doing it, or whether in the final reckoning it was good that they did it."

## To-dos

- [ ] Find the best time for the Week 2 meeting so everyone can attend
- [ ] Reach out to Joe Carlsmith — visiting instructor at YLS this semester — and ask if he'd like to attend the meetings covering his work (Week 4: AI & Civilization)
- [ ] Confirm ahead of time when Professor Restrepo is free for Week 3, to guarantee he can come — he can explain and bring depth to the economics discussion
